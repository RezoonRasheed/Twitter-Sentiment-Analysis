This sentiment analysis project processes tweet data to detect and classify the emotional tone behind each tweet. 
It involves cleaning and preprocessing the text, extracting relevant features, and applying machine learning algorithms to label tweets 
as positive, negative, or neutral. The goal is to gain insights into public opinion and trends on social media by quantifying the 
sentiment expressed in the tweets.

Key Findings
- Trump received more negative sentiment tweets (409) compared to Harris (354)
- Harris had slightly higher positive sentiment tweets (381 vs 371)
- Neutral sentiment was balanced between both figures (260 vs 268)

Technical Implementation
- Used VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning) for analysis
- Implemented text preprocessing including emoji handling and language detection
- Created data visualization using matplotlib for sentiment distribution
- Handled multilingual tweets with automatic translation
